Developed a IDS simulation that built in c# with the purpose of helping cybersecurity students and aspiring SOC analyst practice reading and analyzing logs in real time.
The simulation generates user logins, web and email traffic, failed logins, brute force attacks, phishing attempts, spoofing and malware detections.
Every log generated is color coded based on it's severity type. White is normal, gray is failed logins, yellow is medium, and red is critical.
Why I did I build this? Well I wanted to make something that simulates what SOC analyst see and to help as a hands on learning tool to understand how to read logs.
